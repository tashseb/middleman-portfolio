          <p> Hi! I'm Tashika, originally from the Philippines. I moved to Japan with my family in 2015. I love the culture and food in Japan and knew I wanted to live here. </p>
          <p> I started my journey into programming back in college and landed my first solution developer position at my alma mater. My first job in Japan was as a Technical Consultant at a Microsoft ERP vendor. </p>
          <p> After being away from the IT industry for some time, I enrolled in a full-time, 10-week boot camp in Tokyo to help me fill my technical gap and get into the right path of learning to revamp my technical skills. Since then, I have been interested in learning more things, continuously practicing, and creating positive experiences for people through design and technology. </p>
